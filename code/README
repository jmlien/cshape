===============================================================================
* To compile:

Just type make

If you want openGL display and are using linux, 
make sure that freeglut is installed
http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/

If you don't care about 3-d rendering,
change "OPENGL_ON := 1" to "OPENGL_ON := 0" in the Makefile

===============================================================================
* To run:

Type "shape" to see all the options

A typical run will be something like this:

shape i.cube             # this creates the convex hull of the shape
shape -delaunay i.cube   # you will implement this
shape -crust    i.cube   # you will implement this
shape -alpha  3 i.cube   # you will implement this

There are several input files in data/ subdirectory. 

===============================================================================
* To start:

read shape.h/c and macros.h
read main.c, in particular the part that uses qhull to compute the convex hull

Let me know if there are problems.
