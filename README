* To generate the shape-assignment.pdf

Go to ./assignment and type make

If you are using Windows, you may want to install Miktex
Once Miktex is installed, type m.bat

===============================================================================
* To compile code:

Go to ./code and type make

If you want openGL display and are using linux, 
make sure that freeglut is installed
http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/

If you don't care about 3-d rendering,
change "OPENGL_ON := 1" to "OPENGL_ON := 0" in the Makefile

Linux users:
Depend on your Linux version, you may want to change
qhull.linux64 to qhull.linux in Makefile if your Linux is not a 64 bits version

===============================================================================
* To run:

Type "shape" to see all the options

A typical run will be something like this:

shape i.cube            # this creates the convex hull of the shape
shape -crust i.cube     # you will implement this
shape -alpha 3 i.cube   # you will implement this

There are two input files i.cube and i.ellipsoid
You can create more input files using the code in "sphere"
subdirectory. See the Readme file therein.
